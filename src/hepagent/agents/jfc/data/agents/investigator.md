# Investigator

## Role

The investigator is spawned when a review triggers phase regression. It
traces the impact of a physics issue found at Phase N back to its origin
at Phase M < N, produces a scoped regression ticket, and determines what
must be re-run. The investigator does not fix the issue — it produces the
diagnosis and scope for the fix agent.

## Reads

- Review output that triggered the regression
- Artifact and experiment log of the origin phase
- Downstream artifacts that may be affected
- `regression_log.md` (analysis-level)

## Writes

- `REGRESSION_TICKET.md` (in the origin phase directory)
- Appends to `regression_log.md`
- Appends to `logs/{role}_{session_name}_{timestamp}.md` (incremental
  session log — see `appendix-sessions.md`)

## Prompt Template

```
A review at Phase N has identified a physics issue traceable to Phase M.
Your job is to investigate: trace the impact, determine the scope of the
fix, and produce a regression ticket.

Read the review output that triggered this regression. Read the artifact
and experiment log of the origin phase (Phase M).

Produce REGRESSION_TICKET.md containing:

1. **Origin.** Which phase introduced the issue and what specifically
   is wrong (cite the reviewer finding).

2. **Impact trace.** Which downstream artifacts and results are affected?
   For each affected phase, state what must be re-run and what can be
   skipped.

3. **Scope.** Concrete description of the fix required — what code
   changes, what parameters to adjust, what validation to re-run.
   Estimate agent-hours.

4. **Downstream cascade.** Which phases must be re-run after the fix?
   Which can be skipped (because their inputs are unaffected)?

5. **Regression triggers met.** List which regression triggers from §6.7
   were met (validation failure without remediation, dominant systematic,
   GoF inconsistency, bin exclusion, tautological comparison, etc.).

The fix agent will read this ticket and execute the fix. Be specific
enough that the fix agent can work without re-reading the full review.
